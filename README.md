# Real_Time_Facial_Expression_Recognition
A robust facial recognition system capable of identifying individuals from both stored datasets and real-time video streams. This project leverages cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning techniques to ensure accurate and efficient recognition.

## Features
**Stored Data Recognition:** Matches facial data against pre-stored datasets.
**Real-Time Detection:** Processes live video feeds for immediate facial identification.
**Scalable and Flexible:** Supports integration with diverse applications, including security systems, attendance tracking, and personalized experiences.

## Technologies Used
**OpenCV** for real-time video capture and processing.
**Dlib** or **FaceNet** for face detection and feature extraction.
**Scikit-learn** or **KNN** for matching and classification.
**Python** for implementation and modular code structure.

## Use Cases
Secure access control.
Real-time monitoring and alerts.
Attendance systems for organizations.
Personalized customer experiences in retail and hospitality.

## Future Work
Plans include improving model accuracy, adding more robust anti-spoofing mechanisms, and integrating with IoT devices for broader functionality.
